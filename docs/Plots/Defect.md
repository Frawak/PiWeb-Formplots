### Defect plot

![Defect file format][preview]

#### Description

The defect file format is used to transport information about one or more defects. This includes surface defects like scratches or dirt, as well as spatial defects like cavities. PiWeb Designer offers multiple elements that can read and display the data that is written in this format. Besides the general data structure, the defect file format has nothing much in common with the other formplot formats.

#### Point structure

The format defines one point for every defect, which has a position and a size. Be aware, that the position refers to the corner of the defects bounding box, which has minimal values for every coordinate.

![defect position](gfx/DefectPosition.png "Defect position")

Besides the `Position` and `Size` parameters, every point contains an arbitrary number of voxels / pixels that define its shape. Be aware that both, the defect size and position als well as the voxel size and position must be either normalized to a range of [0..1] or you must specify the parameter `Size` on the **nominal** geometry.

* Position	
* Size	
* Voxels (Array)
	* Position
	* Size

>While the datatype of all parameters is a three-dimensional vector, the format is also designed for two-dimensional data. In this case, just define two dimensions instead of three.

#### Geometry

The defect geometry contains a parameter named `Size`, which is only relevant on the **nominal** geometry. This is the size of the image or geometry from which the defect positions and sizes originate from. PiWeb **will not** assume this size from any provided image or geometry that is used in the report.

#### Example

```csharp
public static Formplot Create( BitmapSource img )
{
	var plot = new DefectPlot();
	var points = new List<Defect>();

	plot.Nominal.Size = new Vector( img.PixelWidth, img.PixelHeight );

	var data = new byte[img.PixelWidth * img.PixelHeight * 4];
	img.CopyPixels( data, img.PixelWidth * 4, 0 );

	var voxels = new List<Voxel>();

	for( var x = 0; x < img.PixelWidth; x++ )
	{
		for( var y = 0; y < img.PixelHeight; y++ )
		{
			var position = ( y * img.PixelWidth + x ) * 4;
			var r = data[ position ];
			var g = data[ position + 1 ];
			var b = data[ position + 2 ];
			var a = data[ position + 3 ];

			//Let's say, everthing other than white is a defect
			if( r != 255 || g != 255 || b != 255 || a != 255 )
				voxels.Add( new Voxel( new Vector( x, y ), new Vector( 1, 1 ) ) );
		}
	}

	var bounds = GetBounds( voxels );
	if( bounds != Rect.Empty )
		points.Add( new Defect( 
			new Segment( "All", SegmentTypes.None ),
			new Vector( bounds.X, bounds.Y ), 
			new Vector( bounds.Width, bounds.Height ) )
		{
			Voxels = voxels.ToArray()
		} );

	plot.Points = points;
	return plot;
}
```

#### Remarks

To add additional information to each defect, you can use the parameter `PropertyList`. You can access the properties, as well as the size and position of the defect, with new system variables:

| Name						| Description 													|
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|`${DefectIndex}`			|Index of the defect in the defect file							|
|`${DefectPosition.X}`		|Position of the defect in the specified dimension				|
|`${DefectSize.X}`			|Size of the defect in the specified dimension					|
|`${DefectReferenceSize.X}`	|Reference size in the specified dimension						|
|`${DefectSegmentName}`		|Name of the segment to which the defect is attached			|
|`${DefectSegmentType}`		|Type of the segment to which the defect is attached			|
|`${DefectTolerance.X}`		|Tolerance of the defect in the specified dimension				|
|`${DefectProperty("Key")}`	|Value of the property with the specified key					|

The defect plot introduces a spatial tolerance type. Since there are a lot of different ways on how to interpret these tolerances, there's no built in way to evaluate tolerance usage or tolerance overrun of defects. In all report elements related to defects, you have the possiblity to use system variable expressions to filter or colorize the defects.
